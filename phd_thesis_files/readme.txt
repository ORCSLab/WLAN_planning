AP_cand_positions: candidate points to instalation of APs
x -> x coordinate / y -> y coordinate / z -> z coordinate / F -> floor / B -> block

Barriers: positions of barriers (walls and floor) of ambient
x1 x2 -> initial and final points (x1 and x2) of the walls
y1 y2 -> coordinates y1 and y2 
z1 z2 -> coordinates z1 and z2 of the wall  /  F = floor  /  T = type/material

BW_consumption: Bandwidth consumption of clients, in Mbps
colums -> BW ofclients

client_positions: Coordinates of clients
x -> x coordinate / y -> y coordinate / z -> z coordinate / F -> floor

RSS_AP_CL: Receive Signal Strength estimated from the AP to clients, in dBm
rows -> APs  /  colums -> clients

RSS_ptdeman_ptdeman: estimated RSS from the cand. points to cand. points, in dBm
rows -> cand. points  /  colums -> cand. points
